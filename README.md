# Capitalism X
## Installation
Here’s how to start the game locally on your computer:
1. Install Node.js via https://nodejs.org/
2. Open Terminal (macOS) or cmd (Windows)
3. Navigate into the CapitalismX directory (default is ~/Documents/GitHub/CapitalismX)
```cd ~/Documents/GitHub/CapitalismX```
4. Type ```npm install``` and hit return. The project dependencies (third-party Node.js libraries and modules this app uses) will now be installed. This may take a few minutes if you do it for the first time.
5.  Type ```npm start``` and hit return. A window of your default browser should open and run the app on http://localhost:3000.

## Gameplay
There are 3 graphics settings for our game: low, medium and best. You can change them in the menu. The “best” setting uses antialiasing, shadows and the resolution is the native resolution of your screen. It looks by far the best but will probably be a slideshow if your laptop doesn’t have a dedicated graphics card. Try the medium or low settings in this case.

You can navigate the map by dragging it with your mouse and rotate the map using secondary click (right-click).
